    <h1> About cats</h1>

    <p>
        The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
        mammal.<br> It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have
        shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house
        pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for
        companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like
        mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense
        of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.

    <h2>Colors and patterns </h2>
    <p> Mutation has generated the colorful palette of coat colors seen today. However, regardless of the color or
        pattern on the outside, all domestic cats are genetically tabbies like their wildcat ancestors. The tabby
        pattern may not be expressed because of modifying genes. For example, the dominant white gene masks the
        expression of other genes, meaning a totally white cat could possess the genes for nearly any pattern or color.
        These genes may be passed along to subsequent generations. All cats, regardless of their appearance, have genes
        for one or more of the following tabby patterns:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Classic (blotched) tabby: wide stripes with swirls, or “bull’s-eyes,” on the sides</li>
        <li> Mackerel tabby: thinner stripes extending down the sides like the bones of a fish</li>
        <li>Ticked tabby (agouti): alternating dark and light bands on each hair strand</li>
        <li> Spotted: dark spots on a lighter background with tabby striping on face, legs, and tail</li>
    </ul>
